# IoT-Industrial-safety-Monitoring-project
“Developed an IoT-based Industrial Safety Monitoring System using ESP32 and sensors for real-time hazard detection and alerts.
Project Description:
Developed an IoT-based Industrial Safety Monitoring System using ESP32 and multiple sensors for real-time hazard detection and alerts. The system monitors safety hazards such as gas leaks, fire, and motion detection to ensure workplace safety.

Features:

Real-time hazard detection

Automatic alerts via buzzer or notification

Uses multiple sensors (MQ-2 Gas Sensor, PIR Motion Sensor, SW-420 Vibration Sensor)

ESP32 microcontroller for IoT integration

Hardware Used:

ESP32 Microcontroller

MQ-2 Gas Sensor

PIR Motion Sensor

SW-420 Vibration Sensor

Buzzer

How It Works:

Sensors continuously monitor the environment.

Data is sent to ESP32 for processing.

When a hazard is detected, the system triggers alerts in real-time.

Getting Started:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SubhrajitAdutta2002-git/IoT-Industrial-safety-Monitoring-project.git


Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

Connect the sensors and ESP32 as per the circuit diagram.

Upload the code and power up the system.
